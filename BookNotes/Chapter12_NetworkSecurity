Chapter 12: Network Security

Designing Secure Networks: 
  
  1. Network Segmentation
    a. Demilitarized Zones (DMZ)
      - Network zones that contain systems that are exposed to less trusted areas. (Commonly web servers, or internet-facing devices). 
    b. Intranets
      - Setup to provide information to employees or other members of an organization, and provided from external access. 
    c. Extranets
      - Typically setup for external access,typically by partners, or customers rather than the public.    
      
  2. Network Access Control 
  
  3. Port Security and Port-Level Protections
  
  4. Port Spanning / Mirroring 
  
  5. VirtualPrivate Networks (VPNs)
  
   - IPSec VPNs
      - Operate at layer 3
      - Require a client
      - Can operate in either transport or tunnel mode
        - Tunnel
          - Entire packets of data sent to other end of the VPN Client is protected. 
        -Transport
          - IP Header is not protected, but Payload is. 

      - Often used for site-to-site VPNs, and for VPNs that need to transport more than web and application traffic. 

    IPSec can be used with multiple protocols
      - Sec+ primarily cares about switch port analyzer Layer 2 Tunneling protocol (L2TP)
      - **Learn more about L2TP**
        - https://dataprot.net/guides/what-is-l2tp/ 5/6/2023
        - RFC 2661

    - SSL VPNs

      - Typically portal based (Web Browser / HTML5)
      - 

    - Important Considerations for deciding VPN Implementation

      - Site-to-site  OR Remote Access 

        - Site-to-site: For linking multiple sites together
          - usually always on / will always try to reconnect if they fail

        - Remote Access: Mostly for remote users to access resources or systems. 
          - Can toggle on/off at will. 

      - Split-Tunnel or Full-Tunnel VPN

        -Split-Tunnel: Only sends needed data through the VPN tunnel 
          - Benefits
            - Uses Less Bandwidth
          - Cons
            - Doesn't protect all network traffic, only protects what is going through the tunnel
            - Can expose data you don't want to

        -Full-Tunnel:Sends all traffic through the VPN tunnel keeping it secure
          - Good for unsecured network (Public places, coffee shop, etc)
  
  6. Network Applicances and Security Tools 
  
      - Specialized Hardware Devices:
        - Can be purpose built
        - Allow highspeed traffic or other capabilities

        - Jump Boxes
          - Used to securely operate in security zones with different security levels

    Load Balancing



      - Virtual Machine and Cloud Based Solutions:
        - Easier to deploy and scale
        -
